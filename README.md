# Hilti Fleet Management Android App
## Semi-Finalist in Hilti's 2015 IT Competition

As part of Hilti's IT competition, an Android application with a SQLite backend was developed to provide Hilti customers the functionality to easily manage tools and projects.  

Functionality was provided so customers could track projects and tools, automatically allocate tools to projects based on availability, and had the functionality to document tool damage in order to send to Hilti for repairs.
